## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Dependencies

To ensure the API's security, authentication, and efficient documentation, these dependencies have been carefully integrated:

### Spring Security

Used to configure **authentication** and **authorization** within the application. Spring Security offers a powerful and highly configurable framework to protect your application from unauthorized access, ensuring that only authenticated users with the correct permissions can access specific API resources.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Implemented for a **stateless** authentication mechanism. After successful authentication, a JWT is generated and returned to the client. This digitally signed token is used to verify the user's identity in subsequent requests, eliminating the need for server-side sessions and providing greater scalability and performance for the API.

### Swagger (OpenAPI)

Integrated for **interactive documentation** and API **testing**. Swagger automatically generates a web interface that allows developers and API consumers to view all available **endpoints**, their methods, request parameters, and response models. This significantly facilitates understanding and using the API, accelerating the development and integration process.
